## Synopsis

Gears provides keyword-driven framework for web-browser test automation. The objective of Gears is to allow non-programmers do enterprise-level test automation with a simplistic scenario language specification, test execution/debugging engine and CI-friendly reporting. It is built so that it's parts can also be individually plugged into continuous integration or even to anothe automated-test tool. Gears is based on Selenium WebDriver as well as a number of other open-source tools. 
The program itself is written in Microsoft .NET and is licenced under GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE.

## Motivation

This project's task is to bring automation capability out from technical world, so that non-programmer teams can become effective at building and maintaining automated scenarios. Our objective is to give users fully intuitive plain-language control over their applications. This idea should be in line with the concept of [ISO-29119-5 draft](http://www.softwaretestingstandard.org/part5.php) to allow usage of one scenario document both for automated and human readers.

The motivation is to provide an end-to-end solution for automating tests of an enterprise application, but at the same time with liberty of not using all parts of the system if not necessary, i.e. using Gears as an extension to existing free/commercial tools capability.

## Installation

The current early version of Gears application is a standalone binary which does not require any further setup - simply download the latest release and unpack. The distribution contains a /Scenarios folder which contains a self explanatory example.
